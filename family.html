	<p align="justify">I am the last child of four siblings and I am the only girl in the siblings. My father is a fisherman and my mother open her own small business.
	All of my brothers are done with their studies and two of them are working. My third brother just finish his studies in Chemical Engineering at Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang.
	Since I am the only one who is still studying, the preasure are kinda hard sometimes but my family are very supportive. My mom and dad understand me well that I need to spend my time in my room studying and doing assignment so they did not disturb me while I'm studying.
	I am truly greatful to have a supportive family like this and I wish that I could repay my parents' kindness soon.</p>
