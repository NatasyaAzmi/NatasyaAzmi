	Hello and Assalamualaikum everyone! I hope all of you are in a good health. Also, Happy New Year! May God protect us from any illness especially Corona Virus!
	My experience of these 20 years is full of sweet and bitter moment. I learned to be patience in order to live a great life. I'm not born with silver spoon in my mouth but my parents did love me and my brothers lovingly.
	As I grow older, I learned that not everything can be ask from parents and I need to be independent to survive . During pandemic , I work as a part timer at a fast food restaurant while studying online to gain pocket money so that I don't have to ask from my parents.
	I actually feel very lucky for oppurtunity to continue my studies at university and I'm proud of myself to be able to survive until now eventhought we are in a pandemic.
	To all students out there, hang in there because you will realise that there is a rainbow after rain! Be patient and God will return your patience with something great!
