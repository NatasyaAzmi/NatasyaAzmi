	When I was 5 years old my mom send me to PASTI which just a few blocks away from my house. I learned to read and write there. When I enter primary school which is Sekolah Kebangsaan Pasir Gebu that also few blocks away from my house, I already know how to write and read and I able to get first class.
	In primary school, I learn to be bave and independent to meet people. I studied hard so that I could enter a great highschool later on. It is kinda hard to be independent at first because my mom and dad stayed with me all the time but I manage to survive in primary school. For UPSR, I manage to pass with flying colours and decide to apply for an Islamic school at Penang Island.
	I manage to get the school I wanted which is Almashoor Islamic Girls School in Penang Island. This school made me learn a lot about friendship, hardwork and healthy compentition . This school is one of the best Islamic school in Penang. I manage to get good result for PT3 and SPM.
	As for now, I am the final year student at UiTM Merbok Kedah and further my studies in Diploma in Information Management. The lesson and knowledge that I have learn here will be apply in daily life and working soon.
